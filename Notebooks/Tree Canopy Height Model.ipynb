    "\n",
    "New Zealand's oldest growing tree species, kauri, is at risk of being wiped out due to kauri dieback disease. Today only 7500 hecters of mature kauri remain. Locating these remaining trees is important to track their well-being. For more information on kauri trees and kauri dieback disease refer to [Keep Karui Standing](https://www.kauridieback.co.nz/). Identifing the location of kauri trees on the ground is time consuming. Remote sensing techniques can assist with this. Mature Kauri can be 30-50m tall. This atttribute of kauri can assist with identify them from LiDAR data. \n",

    "Canopy height models (CHM's) present the height of trees in the area of interest. CHM's are created by finding the difference between a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM). CHM's present the height of trees in the area of interest. They can be used to assist in the identification of tree species. \n",
