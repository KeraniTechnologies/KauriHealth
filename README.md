# KauriHealth
VEGETATION CLASSIFICATION USING REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES

The purpose of this script is to identify kauri die-back and how kauri vegetation health has changed over time in the Waitakere Ranges, New Zealand using remotely sensed image data from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and RapidEye satellites and LiDAR. 

R scripts: 

1) Creating virtual raster files for Mosaicking of 440 Digital Surface Model (DSM) and 440 Digital Terrain Model (DTM) tiles from LiDAR .tif files in a folder. 

2) Using the R-ArcGIS Bridge:the arcgisbinding Package from https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/r-bridge

3) Exploring the data through various visualisation and analysis (on-going)
